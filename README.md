## System Setup and Application Deployment Script (Debian/macOS)

### Overview

This script automates the system setup and configuration on **Debian-based Linux distributions** and **macOS**, providing distinct and specialized features for each platform.

---

### Key Differences Between macOS and Debian Versions:
- **macOS**:
  - Installs and configures Homebrew as the package manager.
  - Enables macOS-specific GUI customizations like **Dark Mode**, **Dock adjustments**, and **Finder preferences**.
  - Installs GUI apps like Google Chrome, Slack, Spotify, and Adobe Acrobat Reader via Homebrew Cask.
  - Automates Xcode Command Line Tools installation.
  - Allows user creation with admin privileges using `sysadminctl`.

- **Debian**:
  - Uses `apt` for package management.
  - Handles unwanted package cleanup using `apt autoremove`.
  - Focused on CLI tools and lightweight GUI app installations for server environments.
  - Includes Debian-specific services setup.

---

### Main Features:
- **System Update**: Updates all system packages to their latest versions.
- **Homebrew Installation** (macOS): Installs Homebrew if not present and configures the shell environment.
- **Dark Mode** (macOS): Automatically enables Dark Mode using AppleScript.
- **User Creation**: Prompts to create a new user with or without admin privileges.
- **Common Application Installation**: Installs essential tools and applications, including:
  - TeamViewer
  - Tailscale
  - Adobe Acrobat Reader
  - LibreOffice
  - Google Chrome
  - Visual Studio Code
  - Spotify
- **Clean Up** (Debian): Removes unused packages to save disk space.
